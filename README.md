# Description
This is a chrome extension that just monitors certain profiles to know (by soud and green/red dot in the extension's icon)when they came online/offline/typing, how much time they spend onlie/offline and how much time between when they get online and sending a new message/typing , using whatsapp web.

# Limitations
- As it's already mentioned, the extension uses whatsapp web,that means if your phone is not able to reach the interface of whatsap web, it won't work properly.
- If you try to scroll up/down the left chat-side it will take you back to the current tracking profile position this is because web whatsapp doesn't load all chats at once so to get new message notification it's necessary that the current tracking profile's chat in the left chat-side be visible.
- No notification system as of now.
- Selecting the users to stalk should be pretty and persistent.

# Installation
- Clone the git repository by using the **clone url** above.
- Go to chrome -> More Tools -> Extensions.
- Switch on developer mode by checking the box.
- Click on **Load Unpacked**
- Navigate to the folder you just cloned.
- Go to web.whatsapp.com.
- Go to the profile you want to track then open the extension and click on **Start Tracking** , to stop tracking go back to the web whatsapp tab then open the extension and click stop tracking.
- That's it, the extension will now record the history when those people come online/offline/typing/recording audio/new message.
- To see the history, simply click the extension icon by default the current tracked profile's history will show up, to see other profile's history simply select the profile's name and there you have it.
